# Minigames

Chaos League offers various Minigames to participate in.  
Each Minigame will make the player earn points.

The winner is guaranteed to receive the Prize, while every other player will earn a lower percentage of it, based on their current Placement.  
The Prize itself is determined by how many tickets have been bought for that minigame.

There is always one Minigame running, while the other remains in Queue mode. Once a game finished and the winners have been shown, will a new game be selected and once one has been selected will the other game currently in queue mode be started.
