This is the unofficial documentation of the Chaos League Stream Game created by DoodleChaos.

## What is Chaos League

Chaos League is a Stream-interaction Game, meaning the viewers of the stream can participate in it. It is maintained and run by the YouTuber DoodleChaos.

## The Goal

The goal of the game is simple: Capture the Throne, that is visible in the middle of the screen at the top, and keep it as long as you can.  
To capture the throne, you have to [`!attack`] the current "king" on the throne.

However, the king is protected by a wall of blocks, each having certain point values to break.  
To break these blocks and attack the king, you have to earn points, which will be used to break the blocks, substracting as many points from you as the block needs to be broken. If you have 0 points before reaching the king will you be eliminated.

Blocks that have been broken will remain broken until the throne is captured by a different player.

### Earning Points

To earn points, you have to participate in [Minigames]. To participate, you have to either spent Channel Points or Bits to buy "tickets".  
Each ticket bought will be added to a Prize that the winner of the Minigame can earn. The more tickets bought, the higher the Prize will be.

Each game has a different number of guaranteed and raffle slots.

#### Guaranteed Slots

These slots are visible as circles on the side of the minigame. There are a total of 8 slots, but depending on the game are only a select few open, which is indicated by their green color.

The players who bought the most tickets for that minigame will be put in these slots. This also means that if another player buys more than one on a guaranteed slot, will the player be pushed down and if they are on the lowest available slot, be put into the raffle slots.

All players in these slots are guaranteed to participate in the Minigame, once it starts.

#### Raffle Slots

Raffle slots are indicated by green dots above the box reading "Raffle".  
Every player that buys a ticket, but doesn't have enough to end up in a guaranteed Slot, will be put in the Raffle.

Once the game is about to start will players be selected from the raffle at random. How many are selected depends on how many dots there are.

## Minigames

There are various Minigames, each with their own sets of rarity. Visit the [Minigames] section for more info.
